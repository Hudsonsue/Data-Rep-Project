Orders page (order.html) with link back to home page. Customer orders saved in orders table, can add, update, delete order items. 

Staff login page stafflogin.html â€“ has a login to validate with pre existing details in the accounts table.

Menu page menu.html - links to menu table and can add, update, delete menu items. 

Database scripts are on file database and tables.sql. Database called datarepresentation with three tables, menu. OrderDAO, MenuDAO and logonDAO were all connected using mysqlworkbench/pymysql connector and login details 
        host="localhost",
        user="root",
        password="root",
        database="datarepresentation"
unfortunately I was unable to get all tables working on python anywhere.
